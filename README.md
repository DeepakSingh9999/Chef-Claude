# 🍳 Chef Claude

This project is a fun and interactive **recipe generator** built with **React** and powered by the **Chef Claude API**.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The app randomly selects a set of ingredients.  
2. These ingredients are sent to the **Chef Claude API**.  
3. Chef Claude responds with a creative recipe suggestion that uses those ingredients.  
4. The recipe (title, steps, and description) is displayed in the React frontend.
